## SPRING MASS SYSTEMS EQUATION

**Author:** Claire Romney

**Language:** C++

**Description/Purpose:** This function will compute the analytic solution at any time for a spring mass system.

**Input:** 

     m = constant
     c = constant
     k = constant
     f = f(t)
     t = time
     y0 = initial condition of y(0)
     v0 = initial condition of y'(0)

**Output:**

**Usage/Example:**

        springmass()
       
Output from the lines above:
  
**Implementation/Code:** The following is the code for springmass()
