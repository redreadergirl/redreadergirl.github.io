**Author:** Claire Romney

**Language:** C++

**Description/Purpose:** This function will calculate the value of the solution of the logistic equation at an arbitrary point.

**Input:** 

      p0 = initial condition at P(0)
      a = alpha
      b = beta
      t = time

**Output:** The function will output a double solution of the function at time t.

**Usage/Example:**

        logistic()
       
Output from the lines above:
  
**Implementation/Code:** The following is the code for logistic()
